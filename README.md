# La Luna Record Shop: Capstone 1

## Live Preview: 


This website is inspired by the vinyl recoreds marketplace Discogs. In this website, a user is able is to create and account, search for records, and save them to their own record collection. Future site features will include the abliity to view other users collection, follow a user, and save another users collection. 

To retrieve vinyl record data, I used a python library that uses the Discogs API: 
* [python3-discogs-client](https://python3-discogs-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers)

### User Group:
The user group is towards older teenagers to adults of any age. This is mostly due to the fact that some records may not be suitable for children.
